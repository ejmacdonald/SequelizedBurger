# SequelizedBurger

A Burger Eating Application With Node.js/Express/Sequelize/Handlebars

## Description

This application is similar to last weeks assignment, but it uses Sequelize DB method.  

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. 

## Demo

This isn't deployed on Heroku -- I wasn't able to connect the JawsDB properly, so this only works on my local machine with a local DB running.



**Damn**
